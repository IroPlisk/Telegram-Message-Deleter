Simple bot to autodelete telegram messages (Born for use with UVD Downloader)

Me and my friends in our telegram groupchat have an UVD downloader bot that downloads Tiktok, reddit, etc.. links into mp4s, but we had to always delete the messages because they would fill up the chat 9 times outta 10.
So i made this really simple python script that binds to a Bot you can easly make with BotFather on telegram

All you need to do is supply it with the Bot token and its nametag, and there you go!

You can freely edit it to send messages and console feedback however you like, the program is pretty much a blank slate for your needs!
